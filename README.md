# Single-page-portfolio-website
This is a single page but fully responsive portfolio website.
I built this website using html5, css3 and javascript only.No back end used here.
it is a simple single webpage to showcase some basic details about me, my portfolio. 
it contains 4 sections:-
1. Navigation- the top navigation bar contains my name and contact information at the top left and on the right side, it contains four hyperlinks pointing to different sections of the same website , like- About, Skills, Projects and Recommendations.
2. About me section- It displays a picture of me along with a crisp description of me of few lines.
3. Skills section- It showcases all my skills in form of cards alongwith the years of experiences in respective skill.
4. Projects section- It lists all the projects done by me ina neat and clean manner.
5. Recommendation - this section shows few recommendations .
6. adding new recommendtaion- This section cntains a form which will be used to add a new recommendation to my portfolio. A person viewing my portfolio can write a recommendation and then submit it to add it to my portfolio.
7. after adding a new recommendation, a pop up mesaage will be shown indicating that the recommendation is added successfully in my portfolio.
8. Home icon- on the bottom right of the webpage, contains a small circle having arrow i.e., a home icon which is a svg image having link redirecting to the most upper section of the webpage navigation and about me section.
